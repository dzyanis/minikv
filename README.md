#  Simple Key-Value Store (Redis-like)

A minimal Redis-inspired in-memory key-value store:

- Core engine: `SET`, `GET`, `DELETE`, `EXPIRE` operations  
- HTTP API server for remote access  
- Client SDK for integrating into other apps  
- CLI tool for local interaction

This project is designed as a hands-on learning experience to explore concurrency, API design, package structure, and tooling.

---

##  Planned Features
- In-memory data store with TTL
- REST API endpoints
- SDK with idiomatic usage
- CLI tool for `set`, `get`, `delete`
- Unit and integration tests

---

##  Stretch Goals
- Persistent storage (disk or file-based)
- Docker support
- Authentication & API keys
